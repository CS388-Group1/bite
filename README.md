## Overview

### Description

Bite is an app that helps users discover recipes based on the ingredients they have available. By inputting the ingredients they have on hand or scanning their food using the Spoonacular image classification API, users can quickly find recipe options that suit their needs. The app also allows users to save their dietary preferences, create and manage their own recipes, and discover trending recipes.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Food & Drink, Recipe Discovery
- **Mobile:** Mobile devices provide a convenient way for users to find recipes on the go using their available ingredients. 
- **Story:** The app solves the common problem of having ingredients but not knowing what to cook. It provides a quick and easy way for users to discover new recipes and make the most of the ingredients they have, reducing food waste and encouraging creativity.
- **Market:** The target market for this app is broad, as it appeals to anyone who cooks, from beginners to experienced home cooks. It could be particularly useful for students, busy professionals, and anyone looking to save time and money on grocery shopping. Monetization strategies for future iterations include partnering with grocery stores for ingredient delivery, offering premium features for a subscription fee, or incorporating affiliate marketing for kitchen tools and appliances.
- **Habit:** Users would typically engage with the app several times a week, depending on how often they cook.
